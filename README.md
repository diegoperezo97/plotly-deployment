# MODULE 12: Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview of the Analysis

* Roza works at a prestigious microbiology lab as a biological researcher. Many bacterial species haven't been well investigated, and many more are unknown to science. Roza's job is to find these germs and chronicle them. Roza is particularly interested in microbes that can produce beef-tasting proteins. For candidate species research, her lab has teamed up with Improbable Beef, a food business.

* Algae, fungus, and microbes found on plant roots have been successfully synthesized in labs around the country. Improbable Beef, on the other hand, is still on the lookout for the elusive bacterium that will produce the right flavor.

* Roza believes there is a microbe that can provide the next greatest flavor, and she believes it may be discovered right here in the United States in germs found on the human body.

* Here's what Roza has learned thus far. Thousands of different bacteria species live in the human body, and various areas of the body house different kinds. Bacteria found in the stomach, for example, are not the same as those found on a person's eyelashes. Furthermore, even in the same region, bacterial species might differ between individuals. Roza believes the best bacteria for making synthetic beef may be found in the belly button, or at least in someone's belly button.

* Roza has taken samples from people's navels all throughout the nation to discover bacterial species that populate our belly buttons in order to test her idea. The identity of each individual is concealed. Instead, they've been given a number. Roza now intends to create a dashboard that will be accessible to both her research participants and fellow researchers. Participants in the research will be able to go to a website and enter their ID numbers to find out which bacteria species exist in their navels.

### Purpose
* Help Roza create, present, and share patients' results through a dashboard programmed using JavaScript's library Plotly, HTML and CSS without the need to install any program on the users' devices, but rather, by publishing it online using GitHub Pages so that anyone who wishes to acces this information is free to do so by only using the dashboard's URL.
